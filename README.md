### Yash Nayak Portfolio

🚀 **My new portfolio is LIVE!**
…and it might just make you feel like you’re opening a new OS 👨‍💻

I wanted something more than just “another scrolling portfolio,”
so I built one that *feels alive* — with openable tabs, draggable windows,
a taskbar, and even a night-mode that goes full hacker-vibe 🟩.

Every click gives you that sweet *system-like* feel —
because why settle for static when you can make it interactive?
